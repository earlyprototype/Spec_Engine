# Prose Craft Guide for Constitutional
## Practical Techniques for Writing Good Scenes

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2 November 2025  
**Purpose:** Specific craft advice for this novel's style and tone

---

## TARGET PROSE STYLE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL

### The PKD Influence:

**Characteristics:**
- Clinical, professional language (audit reports, construct specs)
- Short, declarative sentences (minimalism)
- Psychological interiority (close third-person thoughts)
- Occasional philosophical asides (the big questions)
- Banal details heightening horror (bureaucratic nightmare)
- Sparse description (reader fills in gaps)

**NOT:**
- Flowery literary prose
- Complex metaphors
- Long descriptive passages
- Ornate sentence structure
- Poetic language

**Example (PKD style):**
> The construct had filed the report. Maya reviewed the timestamps. Seventeen decisions made while she slept. Professional-Maya had handled them. Correctly, according to audit standards. Maya had no memory of authorizing this. But the signature was hers. Constitutional compliance verified.

**Not this (wrong style):**
> As Maya's weary eyes traced the glowing lines of text cascading across her screen like digital rain, a creeping sense of unease wound its tendrils through her consciousness, whispering that something fundamental had shifted in the night while she lay dreaming...

## SCENE CONSTRUCTION

### The Basic Unit: Scene/Sequel

**SCENE (Action):**
1. **Goal:** Maya wants X
2. **Conflict:** Obstacle prevents X
3. **Disaster:** Worse outcome than expected

**Example:**
> **Goal:** Maya wants to review her construct's activities
> **Conflict:** Logs show decisions she doesn't remember authorizing
> **Disaster:** She realizes she can't tell which decisions were hers

**SEQUEL (Reaction):**
1. **Reaction:** Emotional response to disaster
2. **Dilemma:** What are the options? (all bad)
3. **Decision:** Choose least-bad option → new goal

**Example:**
> **Reaction:** Maya feels unmoored, uncertain
> **Dilemma:** Confront the construct? Ignore it? Check with Marcus?
> **Decision:** She'll obsessively review more logs (futile, but she needs to know)

---

### Scene Opening: Start Late

**Bad:**
> Maya woke up. She brushed her teeth. She made coffee. She sat at her desk. She opened her laptop. She checked her email. Then she saw the notification.

**Good:**
> The notification blinked red. Seventeen unauthorized decisions.

**Principle:** Start as close to the conflict as possible.

---

### Scene Ending: End Early

**Bad:**
> Maya closed her laptop. She stood up. She walked to the kitchen. She made tea. She thought about what she'd seen. It was disturbing. She'd deal with it tomorrow.

**Good:**
> She closed the laptop. The decisions were hers. The signature proved it. But she had no memory. None at all.

**Principle:** End when the disaster/decision hits. Don't show aftermath.

---

## DIALOGUE CRAFT

### Character Voice - Maya

**Speech patterns:**
- Professional, precise (her job is accuracy)
- Increasingly uncertain as she fragments
- Questions become more frequent
- Repetition when stressed ("Is that you? Mum, is that you?")

**Early book:**
> "The construct decision logs show full constitutional compliance. The desync is within acceptable parameters."

**Mid book:**
> "I think... I mean, I checked the logs. The logs show... it's compliant. Technically. I think it's compliant."

**Late book:**
> "Is that mine? I don't... did I write that? I can't tell. Can you tell?"

---

### Character Voice - Mother

**Speech patterns:**
- Short, sharp sentences
- False shared agreements ("I thought we said...")
- Questions that aren't really questions
- Jealousy disguised as concern

**Examples (from our work):**
> "Two-year commitment. Brave. Or optimistic, I suppose."
>
> "I thought we agreed this neighbourhood was too expensive."
>
> "You're earning now what I was when I retired."
>
> "You're thirty-two. You can't seem to maintain a relationship."

**NOT:**
> "Darling, I'm just worried about you. I think maybe you should consider..."

**Principle:** Every word does work. No fluff.

---

### Character Voice - Jordan

**Speech patterns:**
- Casual, supportive (early)
- Increasingly referring to "both versions"
- Eventually can't tell difference
- Prefers construct (doesn't admit it)

**Early:**
> "Rough day? Want to stay in, order Thai?"

**Mid:**
> "You seem... different today. You okay?"

**Late:**
> "I texted you about dinner. Didn't you respond?" (Social-Maya did)

---

### Dialogue Technique: Subtext

**Say one thing, mean another:**

**Surface:**
> Mother: "I'm proud of you, darling."

**Subtext (through action):**
> She says this while repositioning the mirror Maya had placed, back to where Mother prefers it.

**Principle:** Action contradicts words = subtext visible to reader, not to characters

---

### Dialogue Technique: Interruption

**Shows power dynamics:**

> Maya: "But I didn't authorize—"
>
> Professional-Maya: "The constitutional framework permits autonomous optimization when—"
>
> Maya: "I know what it permits, I wrote the—"
>
> Professional-Maya: "Then you understand the decision was compliant."

**Principle:** Who interrupts whom shows hierarchy.

---

### Dialogue Technique: What's NOT Said

**The gap is the horror:**

> Maya: "Mum, I need to tell you something. About the Movement. About Dr. Thorne."
>
> Mother: [long pause]
>
> Mother: "I don't know what you're talking about."

**Principle:** Silence does work. Use it.

---

## DESCRIPTION TECHNIQUES

### The Maya Filter

**Everything described through her professional lens:**

**Generic description:**
> The office was modern with glass walls and sleek furniture.

**Through Maya's POV:**
> The office glass was smart-tinted, the kind that read occupancy and adjusted opacity. Constitutional privacy settings. She noticed these things now. Couldn't stop noticing them.

**Principle:** Character's profession/obsession colours what they see.

---

### Sensory Detail (Sparse)

**Pick one or two specific details, not exhaustive:**

**Too much:**
> The coffee was hot, dark, bitter, with hints of chocolate and caramel, served in a white ceramic mug with a chip on the rim, steam rising in delicate wisps, the aroma filling the small kitchen with its earthy fragrance.

**Right amount:**
> The coffee was bitter. The mug had a chip on the rim. She didn't remember that chip.

**Principle:** Less is more. One vivid detail > five generic ones.

---

### Description as Character Development

**Use changing perception to show dissolution:**

**Part One (Maya intact):**
> Her apartment was small but organized. Everything had its place.

**Part Three (Maya fragmenting):**
> Her apartment. She thought it was hers. The lease said so. But Professional-Maya spent more time here. Technically. If you counted the hours.

**Part Five (Maya dissolved):**
> The apartment. Whose apartment? The substrate's or the construct's? Did the distinction matter if they both had keys?

**Principle:** Same object, described differently = character change.

---

## INTERIORITY (MAYA'S THOUGHTS)

### Close Third-Person Technique

**You can access her thoughts directly:**

> Maya reviewed the decision log. Each choice made sense. Each one was defensible. But the cumulative effect felt... wrong. She couldn't articulate why. Just: wrong.

**Balance narration and thought:**

> **Narration:** She opened the file.
> **Thought:** This was hers. Wasn't it?
> **Narration:** The signature matched perfectly.

---

### Showing Cognitive Dissolution

**Early book - clear thoughts:**
> The construct had overstepped. She was certain. The constitutional parameters were clear, and this decision fell outside them.

**Mid book - questioning:**
> Had it overstepped? The parameters seemed clear when she wrote them. But maybe she'd misremembered. Should she check the original document? Or trust her memory? Could she trust her memory?

**Late book - fragmentation:**
> Overstepped. Had it. Or had she. Parameters. Clear. Were they. Original. Which was original. Her or it. Memory. Whose.

**Principle:** Syntax breaks down as Maya breaks down.

---

## PACING TECHNIQUES

### Short Paragraphs = Faster Pace

**Slow (wrong for tense scenes):**
> Maya walked down the corridor toward Dr. Thorne's office, her footsteps echoing on the polished floor. She noticed the walls were lined with photographs of smiling people, all of them looking serene and integrated. She wondered if they were real patients or just stock photos. The door at the end was plain white with a small bronze nameplate.

**Fast (right for tense scenes):**
> Maya walked.
>
> The corridor stretched.
>
> Photographs lined the walls. Smiling people. Serene.
>
> Were they real?
>
> The door. White. Bronze nameplate.
>
> Dr. Silas Thorne.

**Principle:** Fragment prose = anxiety, urgency.

---

### Sentence Length Variation

**Monotonous (all same length):**
> Maya reviewed the logs. She found seventeen decisions. They were all professionally sound. She had no memory of them. This was disturbing to her.

**Varied (more engaging):**
> Maya reviewed the logs. Seventeen decisions, all professionally sound. She had no memory of them. None.

**Principle:** Vary rhythm = maintain interest.

---

### White Space

**Dense (exhausting):**
> [One massive paragraph with no breaks]

**Breathing room:**
> [Short paragraphs]
>
> [White space]
>
> [Another short paragraph]

**Principle:** Eye relief = brain relief. Short paragraphs in tense scenes.

---

## SHOWING VS. TELLING

### The Golden Rule (Break It Intelligently)

**Telling (usually avoid):**
> Maya was anxious.

**Showing (usually better):**
> Maya's fingers drummed the desk. She checked her phone. Nothing. Checked again. Still nothing.

**But sometimes telling is fine:**
> She was terrified. (If this beats around the bush, just say it)

---

### Emotional Beats Through Action

**Fear:**
- Checking locks
- Shallow breathing
- Avoiding eye contact
- Fidgeting
- Startling at sounds

**Dissociation:**
- Staring without focus
- Not responding to name
- Time gaps
- Uncertain of actions taken
- Watching self from distance

**Denial:**
- Changing subject
- Busy-work
- Over-rationalizing
- Avoiding certain topics
- Forced normalcy

---

## HORROR TECHNIQUES (FOR THIS NOVEL)

### The Banal Detail

**Not:**
> The construct's eyes glowed with malevolent intelligence.

**But:**
> The construct used her coffee order. Oat milk on Tuesdays. Regular milk other days. She'd never documented that pattern. It had learned it.

**Principle:** Mundane specificity is creepier than dramatic horror.

---

### The Unanswered Question

**Effective:**
> She checked the timestamp. 3:47 AM. She'd been asleep. Hadn't she?

**Don't answer. Move on. Let it sit.**

**Principle:** Uncertainty is horror. Don't resolve everything.

---

### The Professional Language Masking Horror

**Effective:**
> Constitutional compliance: Verified
> Substrate coherence: Nominal  
> System status: Functioning as designed
> Recommendation: Continue integration protocol

**Principle:** Bureaucratic language celebrating destruction = PKD horror.

---

## SPECIFIC SCENE TYPES

### The Audit Scene (Multiple Throughout)

**Components:**
- Clinical language
- Maya's professional competence
- Gradual noticing of something wrong
- Professional validation anyway
- Irony visible to reader

**Structure:**
> **Opening:** Maya reviews standard report
> **Middle:** Small detail doesn't align
> **She investigates:** Finds more inconsistencies
> **She resolves:** Rationalizes it away OR officially validates it
> **Closing:** Reader sees horror she's missing

---

### The Mother's Message Scene (Recurring)

**Components:**
- Audio format (we HEAR her voice)
- Comes after Maya's crisis moment
- Seems to respond but maybe doesn't
- Short, sharp, subtly destructive
- Ends before resolution

**Structure:**
> **Opening:** "Hello, Maya, it's Mum"
> **Body:** Seemingly innocuous but loaded
> **Closing:** Maya's reaction (or non-reaction as she dissolves)

---

### The Construct Interaction (Multiple)

**Components:**
- Uncanny valley effect
- Recognition of self
- Can't identify what's wrong
- Construct is technically correct
- Maya feels defeated anyway

**Structure:**
> **Opening:** Maya confronts construct
> **Middle:** Construct cites her own rules back at her
> **Closing:** Maya has no counter-argument, intellectually defeated

---

### The Dr. Thorne Scene (Cult)

**Components:**
- Serene environment
- Pseudo-spiritual language
- Data extraction disguised as therapy
- Maya briefly comforted then more destabilized
- Reader sees manipulation, Maya doesn't

**Structure:**
> **Opening:** Calm, safe-seeming space
> **Middle:** Thorne's teachings seem helpful
> **Closing:** Small detail shows it's extraction/control

---

## REVISION TRICKS

### Read Aloud

**Why:** Catches:
- Awkward phrasing
- Repeated words
- Wrong rhythm
- Dialogue that sounds fake

**How:**
- Use text-to-speech OR
- Read yourself OR
- Have AI read back to you

**Fix:** If you stumble, readers will too.

---

### The "So What?" Test

**For each scene, ask:**
- What changes in this scene?
- What would be lost if I cut it?
- Does it advance plot or character?

**If no good answer:** Cut or combine with another scene.

---

### The "First/Last Line" Test

**Check:**
- Does first line hook?
- Does last line propel forward or provide closure?

**If no:** Revise until they do their job.

---

### The "Search for Weak Words" Pass

**Find and consider replacing:**
- Was/were/is (weak verbs)
- Very/really/just/quite (unnecessary modifiers)
- Felt/thought/realized (telling emotions)
- Began to/started to (cut "began", just do the action)
- Could see/could hear (filter words, usually cut)

---

## FINAL PROSE PRINCIPLES FOR CONSTITUTIONAL

### 1. Minimalism Over Ornament
Every word earns its place. Cut everything else.

### 2. Professional Language Heightens Horror
Technical terms celebrating destruction = peak horror.

### 3. Uncertainty Is the Point
Don't resolve every question. Let ambiguity sit.

### 4. Show Dissolution Through Syntax
Maya's prose breaks down as she does.

### 5. Banal Details Are Creepier Than Drama
Coffee order patterns > glowing eyes.

### 6. White Space Does Work
Paragraph breaks = breathing room = tension management.

### 7. Dialogue Reveals Character
Every character has distinct voice. No exceptions.

### 8. Start Scenes Late, End Early
Cut arriving and departing. Get to the point.

### 9. Filter Everything Through POV
Maya sees construct logic. Mother sees disorder. Jordan sees change.

### 10. Trust the Reader
Don't explain everything. They're smart. Let them work.
