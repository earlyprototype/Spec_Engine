# Professional Novel-Writing Process
## How Published Authors Actually Work

## MYTHS VS. REALITY

### MYTH: "Real writers wait for inspiration"
**REALITY:** Professionals treat writing like a job. They write on schedule, inspired or not.

### MYTH: "First drafts should be good"
**REALITY:** "All first drafts are shit" - Ernest Hemingway. First draft is about getting story down, not getting it right.

###

 MYTH: "Writers work alone in isolation"
**REALITY:** Most work with editors, writing groups, beta readers, agents. Collaboration is normal.

### MYTH: "You should write linearly (Chapter 1 → The End)"
**REALITY:** Many writers jump around, write exciting scenes first, fill in connective tissue later.

### MYTH: "Good writers don't need to revise much"
**REALITY:** Professional novels go through 5-15+ revision passes. First draft is ~40% of the work.

### MYTH: "Writers know the whole story before starting"
**REALITY:** Divided camps: "Plotters" (outline everything) vs. "Pantsers" (discover while writing). Both produce published novels.

## TYPICAL PROFESSIONAL PROCESS

### Stage 1: Ideation & Development (Weeks to Months)

**Activities:**
- Brainstorming
- Research
- Character sketches
- World-building
- Thematic exploration
- Premise refinement

**Output:**
- Story concept
- Character profiles
- World-building notes
- Maybe rough outline (if plotter)

**Where you are:** ✅ DONE (unusually thoroughly)

---

### Stage 2: Outlining (Optional, 1-4 Weeks)

**Plotter approach:**
- Detailed chapter-by-chapter outline
- Scene breakdowns
- Character arcs mapped
- Plot points positioned

**Pantser approach:**
- Vague sense of beginning/middle/end
- Trust discovery process
- Figure it out while writing

**Hybrid approach (most common):**
- Rough outline of major beats
- Flexibility to discover within structure
- "Headlights" - see far enough ahead to write next section

**Where you are:** Partial (have architecture, need scene breakdowns)

---

### Stage 3: First Draft (3-12 Months)

**Goal:** Get the story down, however messy

**NOT goals:**
- Perfect prose
- No plot holes
- Consistent details
- Beautiful sentences

**Common approaches:**

**A) Daily word count** (e.g., 1,000 words/day)
- Pros: Predictable progress, builds habit
- Cons: Can feel grinding, quality varies

**B) Time-based** (e.g., write 2 hours/day)
- Pros: Shows up regardless of output
- Cons: Can waste time if unfocused

**C) Scene-based** (e.g., finish 1 scene/session)
- Pros: Clear victory condition
- Cons: Variable session length

**D) Burst writing** (intensive periods, then breaks)
- Pros: Works with energy cycles
- Cons: Can lose continuity

**ADHD consideration:** Method D (burst writing) often works best

**Typical first draft length:** 80,000-120,000 words (varies by genre)

---

### Stage 4: Cooling Off Period (2-6 Weeks)

**Purpose:** Gain distance from manuscript

**Activities:**
- Work on different project
- Read books in genre
- Think about story but don't touch manuscript
- Let subconscious process

**Why critical:**
- Can't see own story clearly when too close
- Need fresh eyes to spot problems
- Emotional attachment clouds judgment

**Many writers skip this** → worse revision experience

---

### Stage 5: Self-Revision (2-6 Months, Multiple Passes)

**Pass 1: Structural/Developmental Edit (Self)**

Focus on:
- Does plot work?
- Are character arcs satisfying?
- Is pacing appropriate?
- Are themes clear?
- Any plot holes?
- Scenes that don't serve story (cut them)

Actions:
- Move chapters
- Delete scenes
- Add scenes
- Rewrite character motivations
- Fix pacing issues

**Pass 2: Scene-Level Edit (Self)**

Focus on:
- Is each scene necessary?
- Does each scene have purpose/conflict/change?
- Is dialogue natural?
- Is setting vivid?
- Are character voices distinct?
- Too much exposition?

Actions:
- Tighten scenes
- Sharpen dialogue
- Add sensory detail
- Cut unnecessary scenes
- Enhance tension

**Pass 3: Line Edit (Self)**

Focus on:
- Sentence rhythm
- Word choice
- Metaphor consistency
- Prose music
- Flow between sentences
- Paragraph structure

Actions:
- Rewrite clunky sentences
- Vary sentence length
- Cut adverbs
- Strengthen verbs
- Remove clichés

**Pass 4: Proofreading (Self)**

Focus on:
- Typos
- Grammar
- Punctuation
- Consistency (character names, eye colors, etc.)
- Timeline issues

Actions:
- Fix errors
- Standardize formatting
- Check continuity

---

### Stage 6: Beta Readers (4-8 Weeks)

**Who:** Trusted readers (not family), ideally mix of:
- Writers (understand craft)
- Avid readers in genre (understand market)
- General readers (represent audience)

**What they provide:**
- Reader experience feedback
- Where they lost interest
- What confused them
- What they loved
- Plot holes you missed
- Character inconsistencies

**What they DON'T provide:**
- Line edits (that's editor's job)
- Rewriting (your job)
- Publishing advice (agent's job)

**Process:**
1. Send manuscript
2. Provide question list (optional)
3. Wait (give them time)
4. Read feedback
5. Don't defend - just listen
6. Look for patterns (if 3/5 say same thing, it's real issue)

---

### Stage 7: Revision Based on Beta Feedback (1-3 Months)

**Evaluate feedback:**
- What resonates?
- What appears multiple times?
- What aligns with your instinct?
- What doesn't serve your vision? (okay to ignore)

**Common beta feedback:**
- "I didn't connect with protagonist" → Character development issue
- "Middle dragged" → Pacing issue
- "Ending felt rushed" → Structural issue
- "I was confused about X" → Clarity issue

**Revise accordingly** (usually another 2-3 passes through manuscript)

---

### Stage 8: Professional Editing (If Pursuing Traditional Publishing)

**A) Traditional Publishing Path:**

**Acquisition Editor (at publishing house):**
- Decides whether to buy book
- Works with you on big-picture revisions
- Multiple rounds of developmental editing
- Timeline: 6-18 months

**Copy Editor:**
- Grammar, punctuation, consistency
- Fact-checking
- Timeline: 2-3 months

**Proofreader:**
- Final error-catching before print
- Timeline: 1 month

**B) Self-Publishing Path:**

**Developmental Editor (you hire):**
- Big-picture feedback
- Structure, character, pacing
- Cost: £1,500-5,000 (varies by length/editor)

**Line Editor (you hire):**
- Prose quality
- Sentence-level improvements
- Cost: £1,000-3,000

**Copy Editor (you hire):**
- Grammar, consistency
- Cost: £500-1,500

**Proofreader (you hire):**
- Final pass
- Cost: £300-800

---

### Stage 9: Final Manuscript

**Traditional:** Publisher handles cover, formatting, distribution
**Self-pub:** You hire cover designer, formatter, handle upload to platforms

---

## TIMELINE REALITY CHECK

### From idea to published:

**Traditional publishing:**
- Writing: 6-18 months
- Revision: 3-6 months
- Agent querying: 3-12 months
- Publisher acquisition: 3-12 months
- Publishing house editing: 6-18 months
- Production: 6-12 months
- **TOTAL: 3-6 years** (often longer)

**Self-publishing:**
- Writing: 6-18 months
- Revision: 3-6 months
- Beta readers: 2 months
- Professional editing: 3-6 months
- Cover/formatting: 1-2 months
- **TOTAL: 15-35 months** (faster if you push)

## DAILY HABITS OF PROFESSIONAL WRITERS

### Common Patterns:

**Stephen King:** 2,000 words/day, every day, even holidays
**Neil Gaiman:** When on book, writes 8am-2pm daily
**Margaret Atwood:** Writes in afternoons, mornings for correspondence
**Haruki Murakami:** 4-6 hours every morning, then run/swim
**Maya Angelou:** Rented hotel room, 6am-2pm, lying down writing

**Key insights:**
- Widely varied approaches
- Consistency matters more than specific method
- Most write in the morning (fresh mental energy)
- Most have rituals (same place, time, music, etc.)
- Most treat it like a job (not waiting for muse)

**BUT: These are neurotypical writers with this as full-time job**

**ADHD writers need different approaches:**
- Work with energy cycles, not against them
- Burst writing often more productive than daily grinding
- Variety prevents boredom
- External structure (deadlines, writing partners) helps
- Hyperfocus is superpower (10,000 words in one day happens)

**For ADHD:** Markdown often best (no features to fiddle with)

### Reference Management:

**World Anvil** (Free/Paid)
- World-building database
- Character relationships
- Timeline tracking

**OneNote / Notion** (Free)
- General note-taking
- Can organize character/world info

**Aeon Timeline** (£40)

- Pacing analysis

**AutoCrit** (£30/month)
- Genre-specific feedback
- Comparison to published novels

**Grammarly** (Free/Premium)

## WRITING CRAFT TECHNIQUES

### Scene Structure (Most Important):

**Every scene needs:**
1. Goal (character wants something)
2. Conflict (obstacle to goal)
3. Disaster (goal thwarted, new complication)

OR

1. Reaction (emotional response to previous disaster)
2. Dilemma (difficult choice)
3. Decision (choose path forward, leads to next goal)

**Scene → Sequel → Scene → Sequel** (Dwight Swain method)

**Without this structure:** Scenes feel purposeless, saggy

---

### Dialogue Techniques:

**Show character through:**
- Word choice (educated vs. colloquial)
- Sentence length (terse vs. rambling)
- Interruption patterns
- What they avoid saying
- Subtext (saying one thing, meaning another)

**Avoid:**
- On-the-nose dialogue ("I'm angry!" vs. sharp, short responses)
- Info-dumping exposition
- All characters sounding the same
- Too much small talk (cut boring bits)

---

### Description Techniques:

**Show, don't tell:**
- Bad: "She was nervous"
- Good: "Her fingers drummed the table. She checked her phone twice in thirty seconds."

**Use specific details:**
- Bad: "The room was messy"
- Good: "Coffee cups formed a ring on the desk, each half-drunk, lipstick stains at different angles."

**Filter through POV:**
- Character notices what matters to them
- Maya (construct auditor) notices interface glitches, seamless transitions
- Mother notices disorder, things "not right"

---

### Pacing Techniques:

**Speed up:**
- Short sentences
- Short paragraphs
- Active voice
- Cut description
- Increase dialogue

**Slow down:**
- Longer sentences
- Sensory detail
- Internal monologue
- Descriptive passages
- Reduce dialogue

---

### POV & Voice:

**For Constitutional:** Close third-person (recommended)

**Close third:**
- "Maya reviewed the audit" (not "I reviewed")
- Access to her thoughts
- Can become distant as she dissolves
- Allows meta-narration in epilogue

**Maintains:**
- Intimacy with Maya
- Flexibility to distance when needed
- Professional tone (fits audit/construct world)

## WHEN TO STOP REVISING

**Red flags you're over-working it:**
- Making changes, then changing back
- Tweaking same sentences repeatedly
- Can't tell if it's better or worse
- Losing sight of what story's about
- Avoiding finishing

**Time to stop when:**
- Beta readers don't find major issues
- You've addressed all significant feedback
- Reading through doesn't make you cringe
- Story does what you intended
- Professional editor can handle rest

**Remember:** No book is perfect. "Finished" is better than "perfect."

## THE PROFESSIONAL MINDSET

### Your Job Isn't to Write a Perfect Novel

**Your job is to:**
1. Finish a complete draft
2. Revise until it's solid
3. Get professional feedback
4. Implement feedback
5. Publish (traditionally or self-pub)
6. **Move on to next project**

**Perfectionism kills more novels than lack of talent.**

---

**END PROFESSIONAL WRITING PROCESS**

*You now know what professional writers actually do. It's less magical, more systematic than most people think. That's good news - systems can be learned and adapted to your brain.*
