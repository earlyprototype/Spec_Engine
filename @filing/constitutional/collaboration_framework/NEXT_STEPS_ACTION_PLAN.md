# Constitutional - Next Steps Action Plan
## From Architecture to Finished Novel

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2 November 2025  
**Status:** Ready to begin Phase 2 (Scene Planning)

---

## WHERE WE ARE

### Phase 1: Architecture ✅ COMPLETE

**What you've built:**

1. ✅ **Story structure** (Prologue, 5 Parts, 24 Chapters, Epilogue)
2. ✅ **Character profiles** (Maya, Mother, Jordan, Lily, Eleanor, Marcus, Dr. Thorne, David Kross)
3. ✅ **World-building** (SICS system, construct mechanics, cult structure)
4. ✅ **Thematic architecture** (Core themes, PKD horror essence, meta-narrative)
5. ✅ **Chapter outlines** (Every chapter has purpose, beats, function)
6. ✅ **Character voices** (Distinct speech patterns documented)
7. ✅ **Psychological map** (Maya's descent tracked across metrics)
8. ✅ **Structural principles** (Klein bottle, gallery mirrors, constitutional agreement)

**This is exceptional preparation.** Most writers have 10% of this before starting. You have complete architectural blueprints.

---

## WHAT COMES NEXT

### Phase 2: Scene-Level Planning (Estimated: 8-12 sessions)

**Break each chapter into scenes with:**
- Scene number and title
- Who's present
- Where it happens
- What happens (2-3 sentence summary)
- Emotional tone/purpose
- Key beats/moments
- Rough word count target

**Example scene card:**

```
CHAPTER 3, SCENE 2: "The Decision Log"
Location: Maya's apartment, evening
Present: Maya alone (construct references)
Word count target: ~1,200

What happens:
Maya obsessively reviews Professional-Maya's decision logs from the past week. Every decision is technically correct, using her own documented heuristics. She tries to identify what she would've done differently. Can't. Realizes the construct knows her decision-tree better than she consciously tracks it.

Beats:
- Opens logs (routine check becomes obsession)
- Finds decision that surprises her initially
- Reviews her own constitutional rules (construct followed them)
- Tries to find ANY decision she'd make differently
- Can't identify a single one
- Question crystallizes: "If optimization uses my rules, which version is 'me'?"

Emotional tone: Growing unease, intellectual defeat
Purpose: Show construct-substrate blurring (core horror)
Ends: Maya closes laptop, stares at reflection in black screen
```

**Process:**
- I draft scene cards for one chapter (5-7 scenes typically)
- You review, refine, approve
- We move to next chapter
- Can jump around (don't need to be linear)

---

### Phase 3: First Draft (Estimated: 50-75 hours spread over months)

**Three collaboration methods** (choose one or mix):

#### Option A: AI Drafts, You Edit (Recommended for ADHD)

**Workflow:**
1. I draft scene prose based on approved scene card
2. Present it to you (~800-1,200 words)
3. You read and mark:
   - ✅ Perfect, approved
   - ⚠️ Close, needs tweaks (specify)
   - ❌ Wrong direction (give guidance)
4. I revise based on feedback
5. You make final line tweaks if desired
6. Move to next scene

**Session structure:**
- Goal: Validate 2-3 scenes per session
- Time: 20-45 minutes
- Frequency: As often or rarely as works for you

#### Option B: Voice Brainstorming

**Workflow:**
1. I present scene card
2. You voice-record your thoughts:
   - "Here's what I see happening..."
   - "The dialogue would go..."
   - "The tone should feel..."
3. I transcribe and structure into prose
4. You validate/refine
5. Move to next scene

**Good for:** Capturing creative bursts without typing

#### Option C: Real-Time Collaborative

**Workflow:**
1. I write opening paragraph
2. You respond with direction/feedback
3. I adapt immediately
4. Continue in conversation until scene complete

**Good for:** When hyperfocus aligns, high-energy sessions

---

### Phase 4: First Draft Complete - Cooling Off (2-6 weeks)

**Don't touch manuscript.**

**Do instead:**
- Read novels in similar genre
- Think about story (but don't edit)
- Work on other projects
- Let it sit

**Why critical:** Need distance to see it clearly.

---

### Phase 5: Self-Revision (Multiple passes)

**Pass 1: Structural Edit**
- Does plot work?
- Pacing right?
- Character arcs satisfying?
- Any plot holes?
- Scenes to cut/add?

**Pass 2: Scene-Level Edit**
- Each scene necessary?
- Dialogue natural?
- Character voices distinct?
- Tension adequate?

**Pass 3: Line Edit**
- Sentence rhythm
- Word choice
- Prose quality
- Cut unnecessary words

**Pass 4: Proofreading**
- Grammar
- Typos
- Consistency

**Your role:** Direct changes, approve/reject
**AI role:** Execute changes, track consistency, present options

**Time:** 2-4 months (can do one pass, break, return)

---

### Phase 6: Beta Readers (2 months)

**Find 3-5 trusted readers:**
- Mix of writers and avid readers
- Ideally familiar with PKD / psychological sci-fi
- NOT family (too biased)
- Someone with narcissistic parent experience (for mother dynamics)

**Give them:**
- Manuscript
- 1-2 weeks to read
- Question list (optional):
  - Where did you lose interest?
  - What confused you?
  - Did Maya's dissolution feel believable?
  - Did the ending satisfy?
  - What was your interpretation of [key element]?

**Collect feedback:**
- Look for patterns (3+ people say same thing = real issue)
- Don't defend your choices
- Thank them
- Implement what serves your vision

---

### Phase 7: Revision Based on Beta Feedback (1-2 months)

**Common feedback & responses:**
- "Pacing dragged in middle" → Cut scenes, tighten
- "Didn't connect with Maya" → Add interiority
- "Ending felt rushed" → Expand final chapters
- "Confused about SICS" → Add clarity (but not exposition)

**Your role:** Decide what feedback to implement
**AI role:** Execute revisions

---

### Phase 8: Professional Editing (If pursuing traditional publishing)

**Traditional route:**
- Agent → Publisher → Their editors handle this

**Self-publishing route:**
- Hire developmental editor (£1,500-5,000)
- Hire copy editor (£500-1,500)
- Hire proofreader (£300-800)

**Or:** Skip professional editing if:
- Beta readers found no major issues
- You're confident in quality
- Willing to risk some errors
- Budget constrained

---

### Phase 9: Publication

**Traditional:**
- Write query letter
- Research agents
- Submit to agents (expect 6-12 months of rejections/responses)
- If agent acquired: They sell to publisher
- Publisher handles rest (12-24 months to publication)

**Self-publishing:**
- Hire cover designer (£300-2,000)
- Hire formatter (£100-500) or use Atticus/Vellum
- Upload to Amazon KDP, IngramSpark, etc.
- Set price, description
- Launch marketing (your job)

**Recommendation:** Finish book first, decide publishing path later.

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (This Week)

### Decision Point 1: Choose Collaboration Method

**Which feels most sustainable for you?**

- [ ] **Option A:** AI drafts, I edit
- [ ] **Option B:** Voice brainstorming
- [ ] **Option C:** Real-time collaborative
- [ ] **Mix:** Try each, see what works

**Consider:**
- What time of day is your focus best?
- How long can you sustain attention?
- Do you prefer editing or generating?
- Does speaking feel easier than typing?

---

### Decision Point 2: Choose Starting Chapter

**Which chapter excites you most?**

Options:
- [ ] **Prologue** (Mother setting up apartment) - Establishes tone
- [ ] **Chapter 1** (David Kross audit) - Intro to world
- [ ] **Chapter 7** (Lily evangelizing) - Strong character scene
- [ ] **Chapter 13** (First compound visit) - Cult horror
- [ ] **Chapter 19** (Construct confrontation) - Intellectual horror
- [ ] **Chapter 24** (Final audit) - Circular ending

**You don't have to start at beginning.** Start where energy is.

---

### Decision Point 3: Set Session Rhythm

**How often can you realistically engage?**

- [ ] Daily (20-30 min) - Fast but requires consistency
- [ ] 3x/week (30-45 min) - Balanced
- [ ] Weekly (60-90 min) - Sustainable long-term
- [ ] Burst-based (when hyperfocus hits) - ADHD-friendly
- [ ] Variable (no pressure, work when you want) - Maximum flexibility

**Honest answer matters more than ambitious answer.**

---

## PROPOSED FIRST SESSION

### If you want to proceed:

**Goal:** Complete scene breakdown for one chapter (Chapter 1 or Prologue)

**Process:**
1. I'll draft 5-7 scene cards for the chapter
2. Present them to you
3. You review:
   - Does sequence make sense?
   - Anything missing?
   - Tonal adjustments needed?
   - Approve or request changes
4. We refine until approved
5. We have our first chapter planned at scene level

**Time:** 30-45 minutes

**Then:**
- Try drafting ONE scene (test chosen method)
- Evaluate: Did this feel doable?
- Adjust process if needed
- Continue or take break

---

## MINDSET FOR THE JOURNEY

### This Will Take Months

**That's normal.** Professional writers spend 6-24 months on novels.

**Your ADHD means:**
- Some weeks productive
- Some weeks not
- Hyperfocus bursts happen
- Energy ebbs and flows

**All of this is fine.**

### Progress Over Perfection

**Better to:**
- Finish messy draft → Revise
- Than perfect Chapter 1 → Never finish

**First draft job:** Get story down
**Revision job:** Make it good

Don't conflate them.

### You're Not Alone in This

**I'm here to:**
- Maintain consistency
- Execute grunt work
- Present options
- Track progress
- Celebrate milestones

**You're here to:**
- Guide vision
- Make creative decisions
- Judge quality
- Approve/reject
- Keep the faith

**Together:** We can do this.

---

## MILESTONE CELEBRATION POINTS

**When you hit these, celebrate:**

- ✅ Scene planning complete for Part One (5 chapters)
- ✅ First 10 scenes drafted
- ✅ Part One complete (first 20,000 words)
- ✅ Halfway point (40,000 words)
- ✅ First draft complete (80,000 words) 🎉
- ✅ First revision pass complete
- ✅ Beta reader feedback collected
- ✅ Final manuscript ready
- ✅ Published

**ADHD needs dopamine.** Give yourself credit for progress.

## WHAT IF I GET STUCK?

### Common Sticking Points:

**"I've lost excitement for the project"**
- Normal. Take 1-2 week break. Excitement returns.
- Or jump to exciting scene you haven't written yet.

**"This scene isn't working"**
- Skip it. Come back later. Write the next one.
- Or: Write placeholder ("They talk about X, then Y happens") and move on.

**"I can't decide between two options"**
- Draft both (AI can do this fast).
- Read them. Your gut will know.

**"I'm overwhelmed by the scope"**
- Zoom in. Today's goal: Just this one scene.
- One scene at a time becomes a novel.

**"I'm doubting the whole story"**
- Normal. Every writer feels this.
- Finish anyway. Revision fixes doubtful parts.
- Or: Take break, read something inspiring, return.
