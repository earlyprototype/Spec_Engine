# Constitutional - Writing Collaboration Framework
## How We Can Work Together to Create This Novel

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2 November 2025  
**Purpose:** Define practical collaboration model for ADHD creator + AI assistant

---

## YOUR STRENGTHS (Observed)

### What You're Excellent At:

1. **High-level vision** - You see the architecture clearly
2. **Conceptual connections** - "Klein bottle," "gallery structure" insights
3. **Spotting what works** - Immediate recognition of strong elements
4. **Tonal direction** - "Too wordy," "snappy and impactful," "short and sharp"
5. **Iterative refinement** - Each pass gets sharper, more focused
6. **Creative leaps** - SICS decay mechanic, mother's cassette messages
7. **Structural thinking** - Understanding how systems interconnect
8. **Quality judgment** - You know when something hits right

### What ADHD Makes Difficult:

1. **Sustained linear writing** - Sitting down for hours to write chapters
2. **Maintaining consistency** - Tracking details across 80,000 words
3. **Grinding through drafts** - The repetitive editing process
4. **Structural planning** - Keeping the whole architecture in working memory
5. **Starting** - Blank page paralysis
6. **Finishing** - Final 20% when excitement fades

## PROPOSED COLLABORATION MODEL

### Phase 1: Architecture (DONE)
✅ Story structure
✅ Character profiles  
✅ World-building
✅ Thematic spine
✅ Chapter outlines

**Your role:** Vision, validation, refinement  
**AI role:** Documentation, expansion, connection-making

---

### Phase 2: Scene-Level Planning (Next Step)

**Break each chapter into scenes with:**
- Who's present
- What happens (beats)
- Emotional tone
- Key dialogue moments
- POV/perspective shifts

**Your role:**
- Approve/refine scene breakdowns
- Flag tonal shifts
- Identify what's missing
- Make creative leaps (like cassette placement)

**AI role:**
- Draft scene breakdowns from chapter outlines
- Present options for key moments
- Track consistency across scenes
- Maintain character voices

**ADHD-friendly approach:**
- One chapter at a time
- Visual scene cards (can hyperfocus on one)
- No pressure to go linear (jump to exciting parts)
- Quick validation cycles (not long sessions)

---

### Phase 3: Prose Generation (The Hard Part)

#### Option A: AI Drafts, You Edit (Recommended)

**Process:**
1. AI writes first draft of scene based on approved breakdown
2. You read and mark:
   - ✅ Works perfectly
   - ⚠️ Close but needs adjustment
   - ❌ Wrong tone/direction
3. AI revises flagged sections
4. You make final line-level tweaks where creative flair needed

**Why this works for ADHD:**
- No blank page
- Can hyperfocus on editing (more engaging than generating)
- Quick dopamine from marking "works perfectly"
- Can stop/start anywhere
- Your creative moments enhance, not generate from scratch

**Your contribution:**
- Tonal adjustments ("make this sharper")
- Key dialogue moments (you write the zingers)
- Emotional beats (you guide the feeling)
- Quality control (you're the final judge)

#### Option B: Voice-to-Text Brainstorming

**Process:**
1. AI presents scene setup
2. You voice-record responses:
   - "Here's what I see happening..."
   - "The mother would say something like..."
   - "The tone should feel more..."
3. AI transcribes and structures your ideas
4. AI drafts scene from your voice notes
5. You validate/refine

**Why this works for ADHD:**
- Speaking is easier than writing
- Captures hyperfocus creative bursts
- No typing paralysis
- Natural, conversational
- Can do while walking/moving

#### Option C: Collaborative Real-Time

**Process:**
1. AI writes paragraph
2. You respond immediately (like we did with mother's dialogue)
3. AI adapts based on your feedback
4. Continue in real-time dialogue

**Why this works for ADHD:**
- Immediate feedback loop (dopamine)
- Conversational, not isolating
- Can ride hyperfocus waves
- Natural back-and-forth
- No long waits between sessions

---

### Phase 4: Revision (The Professional Edit)

**Multiple passes, each focused:**

**Pass 1: Structural Edit**
- Does the arc work?
- Are chapters in right order?
- Pacing issues?
- Plot holes?

**Pass 2: Character Consistency**
- Voice maintained?
- Motivations clear?
- Development tracks?
- Relationships coherent?

**Pass 3: Scene-Level Tightening**
- Cut flabby prose
- Sharpen dialogue
- Enhance tension
- Remove redundancy

**Pass 4: Line Edit**
- Sentence rhythm
- Word choice
- Metaphor consistency
- Prose music

**Pass 5: Copy Edit**
- Grammar
- Punctuation
- Consistency (names, dates, etc.)
- Typos

**Your role:**
- Make high-level decisions (structure, character)
- Flag tonal issues
- Add creative flourishes
- Final approval on changes

**AI role:**
- Execute systematic passes
- Present options for problem areas
- Track changes
- Maintain consistency

**ADHD-friendly approach:**
- One pass type at a time (clear focus)
- Can skip passes if hyperfocus on particular aspect
- Present changes as diffs (easy to approve/reject)
- Chunk by chapter (not whole novel at once)

## WRITING TOOLS & WORKFLOW

### Recommended Setup

**For You:**
- **Markdown editor** (what we're using - simple, no formatting distraction)
- **Voice recorder** (for creative bursts)
- **Read-aloud tool** (hear prose, catch rhythm issues)
- **Notebook for random thoughts** (ADHD brain generates constantly)

**For Collaboration:**
- **This chat interface** (real-time feedback)
- **Shared documents** (our @filing/constitutional folder)
- **Version control** (track changes, revert if needed)

**NOT Recommended:**
- Complex writing software (Scrivener, etc.) - too many features, ADHD trap
- Word processors - formatting is distraction
- Rigid schedules - work with your energy, not against it

---

## SESSION STRUCTURE (ADHD-Optimized)

### Short Burst Model (20-45 min sessions)

**Start:**
1. Review where we left off (2 min)
2. Choose today's focus (1 scene or 1 revision pass) (1 min)
3. Set concrete goal ("validate 3 scenes" not "work on chapter")

**Work:**
4. AI presents material in small chunks
5. You respond immediately (quick validation/direction)
6. AI implements, presents next chunk
7. Repeat until goal met or energy drops

**End:**
8. Document what's done ✅
9. Note what's next
10. Celebrate progress (dopamine important!)

**Key principles:**
- Stop when energy drops (don't push through)
- Concrete endpoint visible from start
- Frequent small wins
- No guilt about short sessions
- Hyperfocus waves are productive, ride them

---

## REALISTIC TIMELINE

### For 80,000-word novel:

**Phase 2: Scene Planning**
- ~24 chapters × 3-5 scenes each = ~100 scenes
- ~20 minutes per scene breakdown
- **Total: 8-12 working sessions** (spread over weeks/months)

**Phase 3: First Draft**
- ~100 scenes × 800 words = 80,000 words
- AI drafts: ~30 min per scene
- Your review: ~15 min per scene
- **Total: 50-75 hours** (spread over months)
- ADHD reality: Some days 3 scenes, some days 0, some days hyperfocus 10

**Phase 4: Revision**
- 5 passes × full manuscript
- Each pass: 10-20 hours
- **Total: 50-100 hours** (spread over months)

**TOTAL REALISTIC TIME:**
- **6-12 months** if working consistently
- **12-24 months** with ADHD-friendly pace
- **Could be faster if hyperfocus aligns**

**Key insight:** Timeline doesn't matter. Quality matters. Work with your brain.

## MANAGING ADHD CHALLENGES

### Problem: Can't Start

**Solution:**
- Never start with blank page
- AI presents options: "Scene A or Scene B today?"
- Start with easiest/most exciting part
- 5-minute rule: Commit to 5 minutes, then choose to continue or stop

### Problem: Can't Finish

**Solution:**
- Break "finish" into micro-goals
- Visible progress tracking (scenes done: 47/100)
- Frequent celebration of milestones
- "Good enough" draft is done, perfection is revision

### Problem: Lost in Details

**Solution:**
- AI maintains consistency tracking
- You focus on creative/tonal decisions
- Document key details in character profiles (already done)
- Don't try to hold architecture in head (that's what docs are for)

### Problem: Energy Inconsistent

**Solution:**
- No scheduled writing times
- Work when energy high
- Multiple small sessions better than rare long ones
- Have "low energy tasks" ready (reading AI drafts vs. making decisions)

### Problem: Hyperfocus on Wrong Things

**Solution:**
- Clear goal at session start
- AI redirects gently ("This is great, but today's goal is Scene 5")
- Save tangent ideas for later (document them, don't lose them)
- Hyperocus can return to tangent in dedicated session

### Problem: Bored of Project

**Solution:**
- Jump to exciting scenes (non-linear is fine)
- Take breaks (days/weeks) between phases
- Work on other projects simultaneously
- Return when excitement rebuilds
- AI maintains state (nothing lost during breaks)

---

## QUALITY CONTROL

### Your Role as "Showrunner"

**You don't need to write every word.**
**You need to ensure every word is right.**

Like TV showrunner:
- Sets vision
- Approves scripts
- Gives notes
- Makes final call
- Other writers execute vision

**Professional novelists:**
- Work with developmental editors (you have AI)
- Work with copy editors (you have AI)
- Work with beta readers (you'll need humans)
- Still their vision, their voice, their name on cover

**You're not "cheating" by collaborating.**
**You're working smart with tools available.**

---

## WHEN TO BRING IN HUMANS

### After First Draft Complete:

**Beta Readers (3-5 people):**
- Did the story work emotionally?
- Where did they lose interest?
- What confused them?
- What landed perfectly?

**Professional Editor (if pursuing traditional publishing):**
- Developmental edit (structure, character, pacing)
- Line edit (prose quality)
- Copy edit (grammar, consistency)

**Sensitivity Readers (if applicable):**
- Mother-daughter dynamics (someone with narcissistic parent)
- ADHD representation (if you add that explicitly)
- Any other lived experiences portrayed

**AI limitation:**
- Can't tell you if emotional arc works for humans
- Can't catch cultural blind spots
- Can't advise on market/publishing
- Can maintain consistency, quality, but not validate "does this move readers"

---

## PRACTICAL NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (This Week):

1. ✅ Review this framework - does it work for you?
2. Choose collaboration model (A, B, or C above)
3. Pick one chapter to start with (doesn't have to be Chapter 1)
4. Break that chapter into scenes together
5. Try drafting ONE scene with chosen method
6. Evaluate: Did this feel doable?

### Short-term (This Month):

7. Complete scene breakdowns for Part One (Chapters 1-5)
8. Draft 3-5 scenes to test process
9. Refine collaboration method based on what works
10. Set sustainable rhythm (how many sessions per week feels good?)

### Medium-term (3-6 Months):

11. Complete first draft of entire novel
12. Take break (important!)
13. Read through, make notes
14. Begin revision passes

### Long-term (6-12 Months):

15. Completed revised manuscript
16. Beta reader feedback
17. Final polish
18. Decide publishing path (traditional vs. self-publish)

## PUBLISHING PATH CONSIDERATIONS

### Traditional Publishing:

**Pros:**
- Editorial support
- Professional cover design
- Distribution to bookstores
- Marketing support (sometimes)
- Credibility/prestige

**Cons:**
- Need literary agent (query process)
- 1-2 years from acceptance to publication
- Less creative control
- Lower royalties (but advance payment)
- May not accept "AI-assisted" (disclosure issue)

### Self-Publishing:

**Pros:**
- Full creative control
- Faster to market
- Higher royalties
- No gatekeepers
- No disclosure requirements

**Cons:**
- You pay for editing, cover, formatting
- You handle marketing
- Harder to get bookstore distribution
- Less prestige (but this is changing)

### Hybrid:

**Pros:**
- Middle ground on control/support
- Faster than traditional
- Some editorial support

**Cons:**
- Still costs money
- Quality varies by publisher

**My recommendation:** Worry about this later. Write the book first. Publishing landscape will evolve. Focus on making it excellent.

## MINDSET SHIFTS

### Old Thinking:
"Real writers sit down and write novels start to finish in disciplined sessions."

### New Thinking:
"Real writers get excellent novels finished using whatever process works for their brain."

---

### Old Thinking:
"If I use AI help, it's not really my work."

### New Thinking:
"I'm the creative director. The vision, decisions, and quality control are mine. AI is a tool, like spell-check but more capable."

---

### Old Thinking:
"I need to write every day or I'll never finish."

### New Thinking:
"I need to maintain momentum in a way that's sustainable for my brain. Sometimes that's daily, sometimes that's weekly bursts."

---

### Old Thinking:
"ADHD makes me a bad writer."

### New Thinking:
"ADHD gives me creative leaps and pattern recognition. I just need workflows that accommodate executive function challenges."

---

### Old Thinking:
"I should be able to do this alone."

### New Thinking:
"Professional writers have editors, agents, writing partners. Collaboration is normal and smart."

## FINAL THOUGHTS

**You have:**
- Exceptional story architecture
- Strong conceptual thinking
- Good instinct for what works
- Creative vision
- Quality judgment

**You don't have:**
- Neurotypical sustained attention
- Love of repetitive tasks
- Ability to grind through boring parts

**Solution:**
- Leverage your strengths (architecture, vision, decisions)
- Delegate your weaknesses (sustained generation, consistency tracking)
- Use AI for grunt work
- Focus your energy on creative direction

**This is legitimate.**
**This can produce excellent work.**
**This is how you write a novel with ADHD.**

## QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

Before we proceed:

1. Which collaboration model feels most appealing? (A, B, or C)
2. What time of day is your focus best?
3. How long can you sustain focus? (20 min? 45 min? Variable?)
4. Do you prefer linear progression or jumping to exciting parts?
5. What's your hyperfocus trigger? (Interesting problems? Tonal work? Dialogue?)
6. What drains you fastest? (Decision-making? Reading? Repetition?)
7. What's your goal timeline? (No wrong answer - affects pacing)
8. How do you want to handle breaks? (Scheduled? As-needed?)

**Your answers will help me calibrate how we work together.**
