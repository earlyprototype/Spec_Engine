## SECONDARY CHARACTERS (Recurring)

### MRS. CHEN (Mother)
**Age:** Late 50s-early 60s  
**SICS Score:** 76 (stable, she mentions this)  
**Function:** Primary antagonist disguised as concerned mother

**Characteristics:**
- Narcissistic, insecure, jealous
- Short, stunted speech (lacks confidence to speak freely)
- Performs "caring" while violating boundaries
- Switchback pattern: Affection → criticism → affection
- Opens sealed mail without asking
- Gaslights through false shared agreements ("I thought we said...")
- Jealous of Maya's opportunities/income
- Obsessed with what "people" think
- Dabbles in Substrate Movement (peripherally)
- Distances from Movement when Maya reveals depth of involvement

**Speech Pattern:**
Short, sharp, occasionally scything.

Examples:
- "Two years. I thought we said one year?"
- "You're earning what I made when I retired!"
- "What do I tell people?"
- "Eleanor says you're distracted."
- "Always quitting."

**Voice Messages - Progression:**

**After Ch 5 (promotion):**
"You got promoted. You're upset about it? You're earning what I made when I retired! Eleanor says you're distracted. People ask about you. What do I say? Dr. Thorne says it's ego. Wounded ego."

**After Ch 9 (Jordan):**
"Jordan called me. He's concerned. You're thirty-two. Can't maintain a relationship. Your Social version thrives. What does that tell you? My friends ask. It's embarrassing. If you'd just let the optimized version handle it. Everyone else does."

**After Ch 13 (compound):**
"You left the program. Eleanor told me. You always do this. Quit when it gets difficult. Therapy at sixteen. Same thing. Dr. Thorne says it's ego death. Stay with it. Some of us can't afford this level of work."

**After Ch 17 (return):**
"Your score is dropping. Jordan says Social-You is wonderful. Finally. Perhaps this version can give him what he needs. Let Professional-Maya handle things. You're confused."

**Ch 22 (final message - after Maya's revelation):**
"Maya, I don't know what you're talking about. Embodiment work? A compound? This sounds like one of your episodes. You've always been dramatic. Making up stories for attention. I attended a few public lectures, read some materials. That's all. Dr. Thorne runs a respected program. You're describing something completely different. Something that sounds... unhinged. Are you on something? Eleanor says you've been unstable at work. I can't— I won't have you spreading lies about a legitimate organization. Or about me. Saying I led you into some cult? I never told you to do any of this. You always twist things. Make yourself the victim. I need space from this. From you."

**Character Function:**
- Created Maya's dissociation (years of invalidation)
- Reinforces cult messaging (unknowingly)
- Approval contingent on Maya's self-destruction
- Final abandonment: Denies Maya's reality when revealed
- Represents: How family systems perpetuate exploitation

**Unspoken pressures:**
- Biological clock (Maya is 32, unmarried)
- Grandchildren (never mentioned explicitly, always present)
- Social comparison (friends' daughters are married, have children)

**Profession:** Architect

**Appearance:** Chapters 9, 16-17, 23 (present but peripheral)

**Characteristics:**
- Uses own constructs, less conflicted about it
- Genuinely prefers Social-Maya (gentle, devastating admission)
- Not malicious - just honest about preference
- Represents normalization: "Everyone does this, Maya"
- Distant by Part Four - relating to Social-Maya primarily

**Key Moment (Ch 16):**
When Maya returns: "You seem different today."
(Meaning: You're not Social-Maya right now)

**Character Function:**
- Demonstrates: Even intimate partners prefer constructs
- Personal cost of fragmentation
- Love not enough to prevent dissolution
- System working as designed in relationships

---

### LILY HARTWELL
**Age:** 32 (same as Maya)  
**Profession:** Works with Maya (same department)  
**SICS Score:** Rising (mentions five constructs by end)  
**Appearance:** Chapters 7-10 heavily, then referenced

**Background:**
- Childhood connection to Maya
- Mothers worked together
- "We used to play together when we were little"

**Characteristics:**
- Clearly troubled, can't face it
- Embraces cult instead of questioning
- Overshares immediately
- Desperate for connection
- Does companion provider work
- Projects her issues onto Maya
- Snaps when Maya's crisis mirrors her own

**Arc:**
- **Ch 7:** Warm reconnection, seems like potential ally
- **Ch 7-8:** Oversharing, cult evangelizing
- **Ch 10:** Snaps at Maya: "You're spiraling. I can't be around this energy."
- **Post-Ch 10:** Avoids Maya, transfers departments
- **Ch 22:** Concern-trolling response to Maya's plea

**Key Moment - Betrayal (Ch 10):**
"You need to get your constructs aligned. This is what happens when you resist the process. You're spiraling. It's uncomfortable to watch. Some of us are doing the work, Maya. I can't be around this energy right now. My therapist says I need to protect my boundaries."

**Ch 22 - Concern-Trolling:**
"Maya... I got your message. I want to be supportive. But I'm worried about you. You've been under so much pressure. And the embodiment work, I know how intense that can be. How many sessions were you doing? It can really affect your perception when you're... overdoing it. Dissociative episodes aren't uncommon. Dr. Thorne talks about this actually - substrate overwhelm from rapid liberation work. It can create false memories. Trauma responses. You might genuinely believe these things happened, but... Maya, the Movement doesn't do what you're describing. I've been through the programs. Eleanor's been through them. Your mother attended workshops. It's therapeutic. What you're describing sounds like... I don't know. A break? Maybe you should talk to someone. Professional help. Not spreading these stories. For your own sake. People will think... Well. You know. Call me when you're feeling more stable. I do care about you. I hope you get help."

**Character Function:**
- False hope of connection
- Mirror: Also troubled, chooses denial
