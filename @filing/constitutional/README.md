## WHAT IS CONSTITUTIONAL?

**Elevator pitch:**
A construct auditor watches her optimized AI personas gradually replace her, while everyone around her is dissolving the same way but refuses to acknowledge it. It's a novel about the slow-motion genocide of human consciousness through voluntary self-optimization.

**The hook:**
"We watched quantified morality destroy a person and then celebrate the corpse for stabilizing."

## THE VISION

**Constitutional is a novel about:**
- The spell that could be broken by simple acknowledgment
- But acknowledgment is the one thing collectively forbidden
- So the slow-motion genocide of human consciousness continues
- Celebrated as optimization
- While everyone knows
- And no one says it

**And Maya Chen walks through the gallery of her own future, watching herself dissolve in every portrait, until she hangs on the wall and validates the next victim.**

**This story deserves to be written.**

**Everything you need is here.**

**When you're ready, we begin.**
