# CONSTITUTIONAL - SICS Worldbuilding
## Social Impact Credit System Complete Architecture

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2 November 2025  
**System Name:** SICS (Social Impact Credit System)

---

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**Official Purpose:**
"Quantifying individual social contribution to optimize collective resource allocation and incentivize prosocial behavior."

**Actual Function:**
Invisible totalitarian control through perpetual moral measurement and social pressure.

**Critical Architecture:**
SICS is NOT a replacement currency - it's a **gatekeeping layer** that controls access to economic systems. Money still exists and is required, but SICS score gates whether you can use your money to access housing, employment, services, and social participation.

**The Dual-Gatekeeping Horror:**
- Have money? Still can't access housing if score too low
- Have high score? Still can't pay rent without money
- **Both required, neither sufficient**
- Creates permanent anxiety (must satisfy two systems simultaneously)
- Cannot "earn your way out" with money alone

**Implementation Date (in-world):**
~10 years before novel opens (fully normalized by Maya's time)

## CORE MECHANICS

### BASE SCORE DYNAMICS

**Starting Score:** 50 (baseline citizenship)

**Natural Decay:** -0.5 points per day
- Rationale (official): "Every day of life consumes planetary resources. Your score reflects your ongoing contribution versus consumption balance."
- Effect: Cannot maintain score without active positive-impact activities
- Standing still = falling behind

**Score Range:** 0-200+
- 0-30: Crisis tier (housing, employment at risk)
- 30-60: Unstable (restricted access, social stigma)
- 60-80: Stable (baseline functioning citizen)
- 80-95: High impact (social approval, enhanced access)
- 95-110: Elite (moral authority, maximum access)
- 110+: Exceptional (rare, typically program founders/leaders)

## IMPACT VALUE CATEGORIES

### DAILY EXISTENCE (Negative)
- Breathing, eating, occupying space: -0.5/day (automatic)
- Cannot be offset except through positive activities

### PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITY
- Basic employment: +0.3 to +1.0/day (varies by productivity)
- High productivity roles: +1.5 to +3.0/day
- Leadership positions: +2.0 to +4.0/day
- Construct-optimized work: +20% multiplier

### CONSTRUCT USAGE
- Single construct activated: +15 base points (one-time)
- Multiple constructs: +25 base points
- Full integration (3+ constructs): +45 base points
- Annual impact generation: +2.1/day per construct
- Rationale: "Reduces healthcare burden, increases productivity, optimizes resource utilization"

### RELATIONSHIP STABILITY
- Single: Neutral (0)
- Partnership: +0.5/day if stable
- Construct-mediated partnership: +1.2/day
- Marriage: +1.5/day
- Children: +2.0/day per child
- Rationale: "Stable family units reduce social costs"

### THERAPEUTIC/GROWTH ACTIVITIES
- Standard therapy: +0.3/session
- Construct integration therapy: +2.0/session
- Dr. Thorne's programs:
  - Public workshops: +5 per attendance
  - Cognitive track: +15/week participation
  - Embodiment track: +25/week participation
  - Elite Integration: +200 lifetime base boost
- Rationale: "Personal growth = societal benefit"

### COMPANION PROVIDER WORK
- Basic AI companion interaction: +0.5/session (using)
- Companion provider (selling): +3.0 to +8.0/session
- High-rated providers: +10.0/session
- Rationale: "Addresses loneliness epidemic, reduces mental health burden"
- Note: This is where SICS most clearly shows patriarchal exploitation as quantified virtue

### CONSUMPTION PATTERNS
- Standard purchases: Neutral
- Sustainable/ethical vendors: +0.1 to +0.5 per transaction
- High-impact purchases: +1.0 to +3.0
- Wasteful consumption: -1.0 to -5.0
- Rationale: "Consumption choices reflect values"

### NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS
- Legal violations: -10 to -50 (varies)
- Productivity loss: -1.0/day during periods of low output
- Relationship instability: -2.0/week
- Program non-completion: -10 to -25
- Construct deactivation: -30 to -67 (loss of optimization)
- "Spreading misinformation": -15 to -50 (weaponized against critics)

## ACCESS TIERS & CONSEQUENCES

### HOUSING ACCESS
- Minimum scores required for rentals
- Maya's apartment: 60 minimum
- Luxury housing: 80+ required
- Below minimum = 30-day remediation notice → eviction

### EMPLOYMENT
- Many employers require minimum scores (typically 65-70)
- Promotions often tied to score maintenance
- Low scores = productivity risk = termination grounds
- Professional roles: 75+ preferred

### FINANCIAL
- Loan rates tied to scores
- Insurance premiums affected
- Some services unavailable below thresholds
- Banking access restricted under 40

### SOCIAL
- Scores semi-public (visible to employers, landlords, potential partners)
- Dating apps display scores
- Social events may have minimums
- Low scores = social stigma

### PSYCHOLOGICAL
- Perpetual anxiety (score always decaying)
- Gamification of virtue (constantly checking)
- Social comparison (everyone knows everyone's approximate score)
- Exhaustion normalized (must run to stay still)

---

## MONITORING & DISPLAY

### Personal Monitoring
- Phone apps show real-time score
- Daily delta displayed (+/- change)
- Activity impact breakdown available
- Predictive modeling: "At current rate, your score will reach X in Y days"

### Public Display
- Building lobbies show aggregate resident scores
- Some workplaces display department averages
- Transit hubs show neighborhood impact metrics
- Community centers show district rankings

### Notifications
- Daily summary: "Today's impact: -0.3 (decay: -0.5, work: +0.2)"
- Weekly trends: "Your score declined 2.1 points this week"
- Threshold warnings: "Your score is approaching lease minimum"
- Recommendation engine: "Consider optimization activities to maintain trajectory"

### Privacy
- Exact scores not fully public (like credit scores)
- But approximate range visible to those with "legitimate interest"
- Employers, landlords, insurance = full access
- Social connections = approximate tier visible
- Cannot hide score entirely

## EXPLOITATION MECHANISMS

### THE CONSTRUCT PIPELINE
1. Daily decay creates anxiety
2. Work alone insufficient to offset
3. Constructs offered as optimization solution
4. Construct adoption boosts score significantly
5. Creates dependency (deactivation = massive point loss)
6. Seductive relief from decay anxiety
7. Trap: Score maintained, substrate dissolved

### THE EMBODIMENT WORK PIPELINE
1. Score decay continues despite constructs
2. High-impact activities needed for buffer
3. Companion provider work = very high impact
4. Framed as "liberation" and "empowerment"
5. Shame both ways (do it = exploitation, don't = repressed)
6. Patriarchal validation + SICS boost = coercion
7. Loneliness epidemic + need for validation = addiction

### THE CULT PIPELINE
1. Constant score anxiety creates existential distress
2. Dr. Thorne's programs offer high impact + meaning
3. Elite Integration promises freedom from decay (+200 base)
4. "Never worry about score again"
5. Expensive, exclusive (elite access)
6. Data extraction disguised as therapy
7. Sexual exploitation framed as ego death

### THE SOCIAL PRESSURE MECHANISM
- "Everyone's optimizing. Why aren't you?"
- Low scores = moral failure, not system flaw
- Resistance = selfishness (you're hurting collective)
- High scorers have moral authority to judge
- System is self-enforcing (peers pressure peers)

## WORLDBUILDING INTEGRATION

### How to Show SICS (Not Tell)

**Visual Elements:**
- Phone screens showing scores
- Building lobby displays
- Notification pop-ups
- Landlord letters referencing minimums
- Employment reviews mentioning score trends

**Dialogue:**
- Characters reference scores casually
- "What's your score these days?"
- "Below 60? That's concerning."
- "Eleanor's at 94 - impressive."

**Internal Monologue:**
- Maya checking score anxiously
- Calculating impact of decisions
- "If I do this, my score will..."

**System Messages:**
- Notifications on screens
- Automated warnings
- Recommendation engines
- Progress tracking apps

**Never:**
- Info-dump explaining the system
- Characters explaining it to each other (they all know)
- Authorial exposition
- Let reader piece it together from context

---

## THEMATIC FUNCTION

**SICS is the answer to:**
- Why everyone has constructs (high impact, score boost)
- Why haptic work is normalized (very high impact)
- Why Dr. Thorne's cult is mainstream (elite impact)
- Why resistance is impossible (quantified as moral failure)
- Why Maya can't opt out (score decays without participation)
- Why her destruction is celebrated (score rising = virtue)

**SICS demonstrates:**
- Invisible totalitarianism (no government force required)
- Quantified morality (virtue measured, weaponized)
- Perpetual anxiety (decay never stops)
- Exploitation as service (harmful activities = high impact)
- System's self-enforcement (social pressure does the work)

**SICS enables:**
- The constructs (score boost makes them attractive)
- The cult (offers freedom from decay)
- The isolation (low scores = social stigma)
- The final horror (score maintained while person destroyed)

---

## REAL-WORLD PARALLELS

**Inspired by (but more dystopian):**
- Social credit systems (China)
- ESG scores (corporate)
- Social impact bonds (finance)
- Carbon credits (environmental)
- Credit scores (financial access)
- Gamification apps (behavior modification)
- Social media metrics (validation seeking)

**The extrapolation:**
What if all these systems merged and measured individual moral worth with automatic decay to force participation?

---

## CRITICAL DESIGN NOTES

**SICS must feel:**
- Plausible (readers can see this happening)
- Insidious (not obviously dystopian at first)
- Normalized (characters don't question it much)
- Ubiquitous (it's everywhere, always)
- Inescapable (cannot opt out)

**SICS should NOT:**
- Be explained in exposition dumps
- Feel like cartoonish villain invention
- Have obvious "evil government" enforcers
- Be easily resistible
- Have clear alternatives

**The horror is:**
No one forced anyone to do anything. The system just measured, and social pressure did the rest.
