## THEMATIC CONSISTENCY

### Core Theme
**Progressive externalization of self until substrate becomes vestigial**
- Track: Is this visible in each chapter?
- Maya's dissolution should be consistent across scenes

### Supporting Themes

**1. Constitutional selfhood**
- Present in: Construct scenes, audit language, philosophical asides
- Track usage to ensure not overdone

**2. Distributed identity**
- Present in: Multiple Maya instances, Jordan's confusion, decision logs
- Escalates through parts

**3. Quantified morality (SICS)**
- Present in: Score mentions, high-impact language, pressure points
- Consistent scoring logic required

**4. Parasitic exploitation**
- Present in: Dr. Thorne scenes, companion work, cult language
- Track exploitation methods for consistency

**5. Failure of human connection**
- Present in: All relationships, mother messages, Jordan scenes
- Universal theme - should touch all character interactions

**6. Universal dissociation**
- Present in: Background characters, Eleanor, Lily, Marcus
- Everyone is dissolved - Maya just notices

**7. The gallery structure**
- Present in: Character introductions showing Maya's timeline
- Maintain temporal logic (David→Lily→Eleanor→Marcus)

**8. Klein bottle structure**
- Present in: Profession = destruction, Ch 1 = Ch 24
- Track circular elements

**9. Collective denial**
- Present in: Everyone pretending it's fine, rejection of Maya's reality
- Core horror - maintain throughout

**10. Mother-daughter wound**
- Present in: All mother interactions, Maya's seeking approval through destruction
- Track psychological dynamics
