# Constitutional - Pattern Learning Log
## Tracking User's Style Through Edit Analysis

**Purpose:** Record patterns observed from user's edits to progressively align AI prose generation  
**Started:** 2 November 2025  
**Method:** Analyze diffs after each edited scene

---

## PATTERN CATEGORIES

### 1. Lexical Patterns (Word Choice)
**What user consistently removes:**
- [ ] Track patterns after 3+ scenes

**What user consistently adds:**
- [ ] Track patterns after 3+ scenes

**User's synonym preferences:**
- [ ] Track patterns after 3+ scenes

---

### 2. Syntactic Patterns (Sentence Structure)
**Sentence length preferences:**
- [ ] Track average before/after edits

**Sentence structure changes:**
- [ ] Simple vs. complex preferences
- [ ] Fragment usage patterns

**Paragraph rhythms:**
- [ ] Length variation patterns
- [ ] White space preferences

---

### 3. Stylistic Patterns (Literary Devices)
**Metaphor usage:**
- [ ] Increase, decrease, or transform?

**Interiority (Maya's thoughts):**
- [ ] More or less?
- [ ] How presented?

**Description density:**
- [ ] Cuts or expands?
- [ ] Which types of details?

**Dialogue tags:**
- [ ] "Said" vs. action beats
- [ ] Tag preferences

---

### 4. Tonal Patterns (Emotional Register)
**Where user adds harshness:**
- [ ] Mother scenes?
- [ ] Construct interactions?
- [ ] Other?

**Where user adds softness:**
- [ ] (Rare but track if occurs)

**Where user adds uncertainty:**
- [ ] Maya's voice fragmentation
- [ ] How manifested?

**Where user cuts exposition:**
- [ ] Show vs. tell preferences

---

### 5. Character Voice Patterns
**Mother:**
- [ ] Sharper dialogue?
- [ ] More economical?
- [ ] Mode-switching patterns?

**Maya:**
- [ ] More fragmentation?
- [ ] Different interiority style?
- [ ] Professional language shifts?

**Jordan:**
- [ ] More/less oblivious?
- [ ] Casualness level?

**Constructs:**
- [ ] More/less clinical?
- [ ] Technical language adjustments?

## SESSION-BY-SESSION LEARNING

### Session 1: [Date] - [Scene]
**Scenes edited:** 
**Notable patterns:**
- 

**Changes observed:**
- Lexical: 
- Syntactic: 
- Stylistic: 
- Tonal: 
- Character: 

**Confidence level:** Low (first data point)
**Applied to next scene:** N/A (establishing baseline)

---

### Session 2: [Date] - [Scene]
**Scenes edited:**
**Notable patterns:**
- 

**Patterns reinforced from Session 1:**
- 

**New patterns:**
- 

**Confidence level:** 
**Applied to next scene:**

---

### Session 3: [Date] - [Scene]
**Scenes edited:**
**Pattern confirmation:**
- (If same pattern appears 3 times, high confidence)

**Applied to next scene:**

---

## HIGH-CONFIDENCE PATTERNS (3+ Occurrences)

### Confirmed Patterns to Apply Automatically

**Lexical:**
- None yet (requires 3+ observations)

**Syntactic:**
- None yet

**Stylistic:**
- None yet

**Tonal:**
- None yet

**Character Voice:**
- None yet

---

## EMERGING PATTERNS (2 Occurrences)

**Watch for third confirmation:**
- (List patterns seen twice)

---

## SINGLE OBSERVATIONS

**Possible patterns (need more data):**
- (List one-time observations)

---

## USER FEEDBACK ON PATTERNS

### Confirmed by User:
- (Patterns user explicitly confirmed as intentional)

### Rejected by User:
- (Patterns user said are NOT representative of their preference)

### Refined by User:
- (Patterns user clarified or nuanced)

---

## QUANTITATIVE TRACKING

### Edit Metrics by Scene

| Scene | Words Before | Words After | % Change | Edits Count | Major Changes | Time to Edit |
|-------|--------------|-------------|----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |

**Target:** Edit percentage decreasing over time as AI aligns with user voice

---

## PATTERN APPLICATION EFFECTIVENESS

### Scene [X]: Applied Pattern [Y]
**Pattern:** (Description)
**User Response:** (Did it work? Adjust needed?)
**Refinement:** (How to improve application)

---

## WEEKLY PATTERN SUMMARY

### Week 1: [Dates]
**Scenes completed:**
**Dominant patterns observed:**
**Patterns applied:**
**Success rate:**
**User satisfaction:**

---

### Week 2: [Dates]
**Scenes completed:**
**Dominant patterns observed:**
**Patterns reinforced:**
**New patterns:**
**Application refinements:**

---

## PHASE-SPECIFIC PATTERNS

### Part One (Recognition) Patterns
- (Patterns specific to Maya's early voice)

### Part Two (Doubt) Patterns
- (Patterns as voice shifts)

### Part Three (Confusion) Patterns
- (Patterns of fragmentation)

### Part Four (Loss) Patterns
- (Patterns of deeper dissolution)

### Part Five (Dissolution) Patterns
- (Patterns of final voice state)

---

## NOTES

**Observations:**
- Pattern learning requires minimum 3 edited scenes to establish baseline
- User's preferences may evolve as story progresses
- Some patterns may be character-specific (mother vs. Maya)
- Watch for part-specific tonal shifts

**Reminders:**
- Report patterns to user for confirmation
- Don't assume - ask when uncertain
- Context matters (tense scene vs. quiet scene)
- Balance pattern application with creative flexibility
