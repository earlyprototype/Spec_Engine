# CONSTITUTIONAL - Quick Reference Guide
## Essential Architecture At-A-Glance

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2 November 2025  
**Purpose:** Fast lookup for core elements during writing

---

## THE TAGLINE

**"We watched quantified morality destroy a person and then celebrate the corpse for stabilizing."**

---

## THE CORE PKD HORROR

**Not:** "An AI is replacing me"  
**But:** "A better version of me is replacing me using my own patterns, and I can't tell where I end and it begins"

**The spell:** Could be broken by acknowledgment, but acknowledgment is collectively forbidden. Everyone knows, no one admits it.

---

## THREE SYSTEMS (The Klein Bottle)

1. **CONSTRUCTS** - Optimized versions of you, using your patterns
   - Create fragmentation
   - SICS rewards adoption

2. **SICS** (Social Impact Credit System) - Quantified virtue
   - Gatekeeping layer (not currency replacement)
   - Natural decay: -0.5/day
   - Both money AND score required
   - Drives construct adoption

3. **THE CULT** (Dr. Silas Thorne) - Substrate Liberation Movement
   - Exploits fragmentation
   - Promises +200 lifetime SICS boost
   - Data mining disguised as therapy
   - SICS validates cult (elite impact)

**The loop:** Each system creates conditions for the others. Maya's job (auditing) IS her destruction (experiencing). Klein bottle structure.

---

## MAYA'S ARC IN ONE LINE

Professional confidence → Recognizes desync → Seeks help → Help exploits her → Denies reality → Reintegrates → Validates next victim

---

## SICS SCORE ARC

71 (stable) → 91 (optimization high) → 54 (catastrophic low) → 79 (reintegrated corpse)

**Key insight:** Score rises as substrate dissolves, until catastrophic failure, then restabilized while Maya is gone.

---

## THE GALLERY STRUCTURE

**Every character is Maya's temporal future:**

- **David Kross** (Ch 1-2): Maya in 6 months
- **Lily** (Ch 7-10): Maya in 2 years  
- **Eleanor** (background): Maya in 5 years
- **Marcus Webb** (Ch 24): Maya in 10 years
- **Compound members**: End stage

**Horror:** Maya watches her own future reflected in everyone around her, and they're all pretending it's fine.

---

## MOTHER'S VOICE MESSAGES

**Pattern:** Arrive after Maya's crisis points (we never hear Maya's calls)

**Key messages:**
- After Ch 5: "You're earning what I made when I retired!" (jealousy)
- After Ch 9: "You're thirty-two. Can't maintain relationship." (age/grandchildren pressure)
- After Ch 13: "Always catastrophize. Stay with program." (cult reinforcement)
- After Ch 17: "Let Professional-Maya handle things." (construct preference)
- Ch 22 (FINAL): "I don't know what you're talking about. You're making things up." (denial, abandonment)

**Voice:** Short, sharp, occasionally scything. Gaslighting through false shared agreements.

---

## CONSTRUCT-SUBSTRATE HORROR

**The dissociation cascade:**

1. **Recognition** - "That does sound like me"
2. **Doubt** - "Would I have decided that?"
3. **Confusion** - "Which thoughts are mine?"
4. **Loss** - "Is there a difference?"
5. **Dissolution** - "Perhaps I was always this"

**Key scenes:**
- Email review (Ch 8): Can't tell which decisions are hers
- Constitutional files (Ch 18): Finds her own code comments - "This is what I SHOULD do but WON'T"
- The Appointment (Ch 19): Constructs cite her own rules back at her

---

## CHAPTER 1 = CHAPTER 24 (Klein Bottle Closes)

**Chapter 1:**
- Maya audits David Kross
- Validates constructs
- "The construct serves you"

**Chapter 24:**
- Maya audits young man
- Validates constructs
- "Compliance verified"

**Same desk. Same job. Same language. Maya's gone. System remains.**

---

## THE CONSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENT (Unspoken)

Everyone implicitly agrees:
- We are optimizing, not dissolving
- Constructs are tools, not replacements
- We are still ourselves
- Anyone who questions this is unstable
- **We will never collectively acknowledge otherwise**

**Maya violates agreement:** "Mum, this is happening"  
**Agreement punishes her:** Denial, pathologization  
**Maya rejoins agreement:** Chapter 24 validation

---

## VOICE EVOLUTION

**Part One:** Clinical, controlled (close third-person)  
**Part Two:** Fragmenting, questioning  
**Part Three:** Desperate, grasping  
**Part Four:** Numb, distant, philosophical  
**Part Five:** Hollow, uncertain, barely present  
**Epilogue:** System narration

---

## KEY QUESTIONS (Never Fully Answered)

1. **"Is that you?"** - To mother, to self, to everyone
2. **"Am I the problem?"** - David asks, Maya asks, young man asks
3. **"Which version is real?"** - If optimization works better, which is "you"?
4. **"Did it happen?"** - Maya's reality vs. collective denial

---

## WRITING GUARDRAILS

✅ **Do:**
- Show systems through use (no exposition dumps)
- Keep Dr. Thorne as true believer (not cartoon villain)
- Maintain ambiguity about scale (regional? global?)
- Remember money still exists (SICS gates access to it)
- Every character is dissociated, only Maya notices
- Uncertainty: Can Maya trust her own thoughts?

❌ **Don't:**
- Explain SICS directly (characters already know it)
- Make constructs obviously evil (they function correctly)
- Resolve the horror (no redemption arc)
- Let Maya "win" (the spell can't be broken)
- Forget the banality (horror is normalized, not dramatic)

---

## MOTHER'S PERFORMANCE MODES

**Keeper mode:** Cleaning, arranging, "helping" (control disguised as care)  
**Worried mode:** Touching face, frowning with concern (violation disguised as love)  
**Gaslighting mode:** "I thought we said..." (false shared agreements)  
**Departure affection:** Hugs, "I'm proud of you" (confuses violation with care)  
**Voice messages:** Short, sharp, jealous, cult-infected

---

## THE FINAL IMAGE

**Epilogue - Six months later:**

Cursor blinking.

"Perhaps consciousness was always this—a progress log of decisions made by systems we don't control, narrated in first person to maintain the illusion of coherence."

**SICS:** 79 (stable)  
**Substrate:** 0%  
**System:** Functioning as designed

---

## TIME COMPRESSION

**Part One:** 3 months (slow)  
**Part Two:** 2 months (accelerating)  
**Part Three:** 2 weeks (rapid)  
**Part Four:** 6 days (exponential)  
**Part Five:** Hours → Moment (collapse)  
**Epilogue:** Six months later (single moment)

---

## REFERENCE TOUCHSTONES

**PKD:** Scanner Darkly (serene dissolution, drug metaphor)  
**Parfit:** Personal identity (teleporter problem made real)  
**Egan:** Learning to Be Me (the Jewel)  
**Black Mirror:** White Christmas (cookies)  
**Westworld:** Bicameral mind (uncertain origin of thoughts)  
**Buddhist:** Anatta/no-self (corrupted by cult)
