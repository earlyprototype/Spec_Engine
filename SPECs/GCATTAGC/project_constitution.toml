[_inference_notes]
risk_reasoning = "Moderate risk: Business-critical consultancy tool handling client data, but not in medical/financial/security domains. Real client impact requires reliable execution, but prototype phase allows for iterative refinement."
domain_reasoning = "Software development domain identified from web application with multiple components, user interface, and data management requirements."
failure_strategy_reasoning = "Collaborative review chosen for moderate risk level - failures should trigger human oversight rather than automatic continuation or hard stops, ensuring quality while maintaining development velocity."
user_stories_reasoning = "User stories enabled because application is user-facing with consultants and clients as direct users. UI/UX quality and user workflows are critical to adoption."
complexity_reasoning = "Moderate complexity: Five interconnected stage modules with AI synthesis capabilities, but unified application domain with clear Design Thinking structure. Rapid prototyping approach manageable with proper decomposition."
backend_preference_reasoning = "Insforge preferred due to: (1) Rapid prototyping priority, (2) Standard CRUD operations for client data, (3) Built-in authentication and database, (4) Moderate complexity fits BaaS capabilities, (5) User-facing nature benefits from quick iteration, (6) Can migrate to custom backend if scaling requires."
insforge_analysis = "Highly suitable for MVP phase: authentication, database, API endpoints all provided. Stage-based data collection maps well to CRUD operations. AI synthesis can integrate via API. Local deployment possible via Insforge's flexible architecture. Migration path exists if enterprise features needed later."
