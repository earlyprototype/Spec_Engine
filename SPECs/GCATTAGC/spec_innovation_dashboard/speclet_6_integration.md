# SPEClet 6: Integration & Deployment

**SPEClet ID:** 6 | **Dependencies:** [0,1,2,3,4,5] | **Phase:** 3

---

## Goal

Integrate all stage modules into cohesive system, implement cross-stage synthesis (project summary), create export/reporting, finalize deployment, and produce user documentation.

## Dependencies

**Requires SPEClets 0-5 ALL completed:**
- Platform foundation (SPEClet 0)
- All five stage modules (SPEClets 1-5)

## Interface Contract

**This SPEClet MUST provide:**
- Project summary view (synthesis across all stages)
- Export functionality (PDF/Markdown reports)
- Complete user documentation
- Production deployment verified
- Local deployment instructions

---

## Tasks

### Task [1]: Implement Cross-Stage Integration
- Step 1.1: Create project summary view (aggregates data from all stages)
- Step 1.2: Implement cross-stage AI synthesis (holistic innovation journey insights)
- Step 1.3: Build navigation between stages with data flow indicators
- **Expected Output:** Users can see complete innovation journey

### Task [2]: Build Export and Reporting
- Step 2.1: Implement PDF export of project data and synthesis
- Step 2.2: Create Markdown report generation
- Step 2.3: Add email/share functionality
- **Expected Output:** Consultants can export complete project reports

### Task [3]: Final Deployment and Documentation
- Step 3.1: Verify production deployment stable
- Step 3.2: Test all features end-to-end
- Step 3.3: Create consultant user guide
- Step 3.4: Create client user guide
- Step 3.5: Write local deployment instructions
- **Expected Output:** Complete system deployed with documentation

### Task [4]: System Verification
- Step 4.1: Test complete innovation journey workflow
- Step 4.2: Verify data persistence across all stages
- Step 4.3: Verify AI synthesis working for all stages
- Step 4.4: Mobile-responsive testing on real devices
- **Expected Output:** System verification complete

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All stage modules integrated and working together
- [ ] Project summary view shows complete journey
- [ ] Export/reporting functional
- [ ] Production deployment stable and accessible
- [ ] User documentation complete (consultant + client guides)
- [ ] Local deployment documented
- [ ] End-to-end testing passed

## Final Verification

Before marking project COMPLETE:
1. Create test project
2. Enter data in all 5 stages
3. Verify AI synthesis works for each stage
4. Generate cross-stage project summary
5. Export report successfully
6. Test on mobile device
7. Verify documentation is clear and complete
