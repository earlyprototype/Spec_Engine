# Constitutional Slow-Code Engine v2.0 - Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2 January 2026  
**Version:** 2.0 (Major Release)  
**Code Name:** Constitutional Slow-Code Engine  
**Status:** Production Ready ✅

---

## What is v2.0?

Constitutional Slow-Code Engine v2.0 merges SPEC Engine's structural rigour with Lia Workflow Specs' troubleshooting philosophy, creating a unified framework that prioritises both execution reliability AND human understanding.

**Philosophy:** Understanding over speed, when understanding matters.

---

## Headline Features

### 🔍 Troubleshooting Ecosystem
**The "Troubleshooting Cliff" Solution**

Three specialized TOOLSPECs for systematic debugging:

| TOOLSPEC | Purpose | When to Use | Time |
|----------|---------|-------------|------|
| **Troubleshoot** | Fix broken development code | Post-dev issues blocking completion | 2-4h |
| **WTF** | Understand mysterious code | Legacy/undocumented code needs docs | 1-4h |
| **Forensic** | Investigate critical incidents | Production failures, data loss, security | 2-6h |

**Impact:** AI tools excel at creation but fail at debugging. v2.0 provides systematic, constitutional approaches to all three problem types.

**Files Created:**
- `_TOOLSPECs/WTF/` (4 files)
- `_TOOLSPECs/Forensic/` (4 files)
- Enhanced `_TOOLSPECs/Troubleshoot/` with ecosystem integration

---

### 📓 Knowledge Capture System
**Persistent Learning Across Sessions**

Every SPEC execution now generates TWO logs:
- **progress.json** - Machine-readable (status, methods, errors)
- **notepad.md** - Human-readable (insights, decisions, ideas)

**Notepad captures:**
- Key insights and aha moments
- Technical decisions with rationale
- Ideas for future enhancement
- Cross-system connections
- AI and human observations
- Execution timeline

**Integration:**
- ✅ notepad_template.md created
- ✅ Spec_template.md includes Knowledge Capture section
- ✅ parameters_template.toml includes [knowledge_capture] config
- ✅ exe_template.md Section 2.7 implements notepad updates

**Impact:** No more lost insights. Cumulative learning across executions and projects.

---

### 🎓 Education Mode
**Learning-Focused Execution**

New execution mode alongside Silent, Collaborative, Dynamic:

**Education Mode Behaviour:**
1. Runs autonomously most of the time
2. Pauses at critical steps/decisions
3. **EXPLAINS** situation and available approaches
4. **PRESENTS** alternatives with pros/cons
5. **RECOMMENDS** approach with rationale
6. **REQUESTS** human review
7. **EXECUTES** approved approach
8. **EXPLAINS** outcome and lessons learned

**Configuration:**
```toml
[execution]
default_mode = "education"

[education]
enabled = true
approval_gates = "increased"       # How many checkpoints
rationale_required = true          # Always explain why
alternatives_shown = true          # Show options
comparison_depth = "detailed"      # Depth of analysis
learning_pace = "moderate"         # Frequency of pauses
```

**Use Cases:**
- Learning new frameworks or patterns
- Training on project-specific workflows
- Building understanding before autonomous execution
- Onboarding team members to codebase

**Impact:** "AI teaches you while you work" - bridges the understanding gap that creates technical debt.

### 📚 TOOLSPEC Workflow Library
**Pre-Built, Battle-Tested Workflows**

Quick-start workflows for common patterns:

**Currently Available (5 TOOLSPECs):**
- Troubleshoot (fix broken code)
- WTF (understand mysterious code)
- Forensic (investigate incidents)
- Better_SPEC (improve SPEC quality)
- Dev_Analysis (development analysis)

**Planned (13 TOOLSPECs in roadmap):**
- Dev, SpecGen, Test (development)
- Review, Architecture, Security, Optimize (quality)
- Research, Learn, Paper, Recon (research & learning)
- Docs, Innovate, Integrate (knowledge & strategy)

**Selection Guide:**
- `_TOOLSPECs/README_WORKFLOW_LIBRARY.md` with decision trees
- "I need to..." quick selection matrix
- Mermaid diagrams for troubleshooting decisions

**Impact:** Reduces time-to-value. Don't start from scratch for common workflows.

---

### ⚖️ Constitutional Update
**Article XV: The Slow-Code Principle**

Formalizes Lia Workflow Specs philosophy in constitutional governance:

- **Section 15.1:** Understanding over speed requirement
- **Section 15.2:** Education mode specification
- **Section 15.3:** Knowledge capture mandate
- **Section 15.4:** Troubleshooting ecosystem parity
- **Section 15.5:** Pre-built workflow library requirement
- **Section 15.6:** MCP protocol integration (v2.1)
- **Section 15.7:** Enforcement mechanisms
- **Section 15.8:** Rationale and core principle

**Impact:** Slow-code philosophy is now constitutionally enforced, not just encouraged.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to upgrade existing SPECs?**  
A: No. All v1.x SPECs remain fully functional.

**Q: What if something breaks?**  
A: Unlikely (100% backward compatible). If issues occur, see MIGRATION_v1_to_v2.md rollback section.

**Q: How do I use new TOOLSPECs?**  
A: Navigate to `_TOOLSPECs/[NAME]/`, open the spec file, follow prompts. See GETTING_STARTED_v2.md for walkthrough.

**Q: What happened to MCP server?**  
A: Deferred to v2.1 (Q1 2026). Not critical for v2.0 core features.

**Q: Where are the other 13 TOOLSPECs?**  
A: Phased rollout. Priority was troubleshooting ecosystem (complete). Remainder in v2.1-2.3.

**Q: Can I contribute TOOLSPECs?**  
A: Yes! Follow constitutional guidelines, test thoroughly, document well. See README_WORKFLOW_LIBRARY.md for requirements.

**Q: How do I know if notepad is working?**  
A: After SPEC execution, check for `notepad_[descriptor].md` in the SPEC directory. If using v1.x SPEC, notepad won't generate (upgrade required).

**Q: Is education mode worth using?**  
A: Yes if learning. No if experienced with the workflow. Balance understanding (education) vs speed (dynamic/silent).
