[_inference_notes]
risk_reasoning = "MODERATE risk: Production deployment with user data collection (email signups) and admin authentication requires security and data handling consideration. Not high-stakes like financial/medical, but beyond simple prototype or learning project."
domain_reasoning = "Software development domain: Building web application with standard CRUD operations, content management, and user interaction features."
failure_strategy_reasoning = "collaborative_review chosen for moderate risk: Allows human decision-making on critical failures while maintaining autonomous execution for standard operations. Balances speed with safety for production deployment."
user_stories_reasoning = "Enabled for user-facing features: Public podcast listeners need intuitive browsing/playback, email signup should be simple, admins need efficient content management. User stories help ensure design meets user needs."
complexity_reasoning = "MODERATE complexity: Multiple integrated features (episode management, audio playback, email integration, admin panel, pagination, responsive design) but using standard web development patterns. Not complex enough to require microservices or heavy custom infrastructure."
backend_preference_reasoning = "insforge_preferred: Podcast website requires episode CRUD operations, user management for email signups, admin authentication, and email notification service. These are all standard BaaS features. Insforge enables rapid production deployment without managing custom backend infrastructure. Audio files can be hosted via Insforge storage or external CDN. No real-time streaming, heavy data processing, or compliance requirements that would necessitate custom backend."
insforge_analysis = "Highly suitable for Insforge BaaS: (1) CRUD-heavy application with episodes, users, email subscriptions; (2) Standard authentication needs for admin panel; (3) Email notification service available via BaaS; (4) File storage for audio files; (5) Moderate complexity with standard patterns; (6) Rapid deployment valued for production launch; (7) No enterprise compliance or custom infrastructure requirements. Insforge provides all necessary backend services out-of-box."
